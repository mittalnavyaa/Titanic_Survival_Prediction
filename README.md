# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic. It follows the classic Titanic dataset problem from Kaggle.

## 📁 Files

- `Data_after_EDA.csv`: Preprocessed training data (after Exploratory Data Analysis).
- `test.csv`: Test data used for making predictions.
- `model.py`: Python script that trains the model and generates predictions.
- `submission.csv`: Output file containing `PassengerId` and predicted `Survived` values for test data.

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.x and the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
